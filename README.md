# C++ Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of small C++ projects and exercises I developed to strengthen my understanding of fundamental C++ programming concepts. Each project focuses on a different area of the language such as arithmetic operations, control structures, and basic I/O.

## Projects Included

### 1. `helloworld.cpp`
A simple program that outputs "Hello, World!" to verify basic setup and compilation of a C++ environment.

### 2. `arithmetic.cpp`
Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) in C++.

### 3. `calculator.cpp`
Implements a basic calculator using conditional statements to perform arithmetic operations based on user input.

### 4. `findHypotenuse.cpp`
Calculates the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

### 5. `IfStatements.cpp`
Illustrates the use of `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditional statements in decision making.

### 6. `switches.cpp`
Demonstrates the use of `switch` statements as an alternative to multiple `if-else` conditions.

### 7. `LogicalOperator.cpp`
Explores logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) through simple condition-based logic.

### 8. `namespace.cpp`
Introduces the use of namespaces in C++, specifically how to access standard library functions with and without `using namespace std`.

### 9. `StringMethods.cpp`
Contains examples of basic string operations such as concatenation, length checking, and substring operations.

### 10. `TempConv.cpp`
A basic temperature conversion program converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### 11. `Ternary_operator.cpp`
Demonstrates the use of the ternary (`? :`) operator for concise conditional expressions.

## How to Run

To compile and run any of the `.cpp` files:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
